### Howdy! I'm Jacob. ðŸ¤ 

I'm a software engineer working primarily in Ruby and JavaScript on the web. I've worked at quite a few startups.

Right now, I work at [Artsy][artsy] and do a bit of consulting via my friend Brian at [Sage Digital][sage_digital].

Sometimes I create content for myself and other developers. I'm working on a new blog, but I used to write quite a bit on [dev.to][dev_to].

You can also listen to [my podcast][devpath], if you're interested in hearing successful software engineers talk about their careers.

Eventually, I'll release some fresh content, you can [join my mailing list][mailing_list] to hear more!

You can talk to me on [Twitter][twitter] or [LinkedIn][linkedin]!
